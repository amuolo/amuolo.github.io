The exact factorization approach to coupled electron-ion dynamics recasts the time-dependent molecular Schr√∂dinger equation 
as two coupled equations, one for the marginal nuclear wavefunction and one for the conditional electronic wavefunction. 
These equations involve non-hermitian Hamiltonians which are rarely encountered in time-propagation, 
and that make standard numerical methods fail. Despite the difficulties, the exactly factorized equations enable the 
definition of exact scalar and vector potentials, namely the exact potential energy surface and the exact Berry-type 
vector potential, respectively. Therefore, a numerical solution of the coupled equations would provides much insight 
into fundamental aspects of coupled dynamics of subsystems. This is the true driving force for this research project.

Through the exact factorization, the molecular geometric phase can be identified as a rigorous concept without approximation. 
Similarly, the time-dependent potential energy surface appearing in the exact nuclear equation of motion is unique 
(up to within a gauge transformation), as opposed to the traditional Born Huang expansion that couples different surfaces.
Hence, the exact classical forces (coming from the scalar and vector potentials) acting on the nuclei are also unique, 
which in turn allows to devise semi-classical methods for the ion subsystem. 

Lastly, what makes the exact factorization so powerful and versatile is that the same universal procedure can be applied 
to any interacting quantum system and to any subdivision, i.e. not only the electron-ion separation. 
What makes the exact factorization distinct from other embedding schemes is the fact that the derivation of equations 
of motion for the subsystems is done without approximation.
