    - title: Quantum computing
      items: 
        - Quantum computing has the potential to solve long-standing computational problems that are considered
          intractable with classical computers. 
        - Optimization problems are ubiquitous, and improvements in this field can lead to groundbreaking discoveries.

    - title: Nuclear quantum effects 
      items: 
        - Rigorous prediction of chemical reactivity and dynamical properties through 
          the explicit treatment of quantum effects beyond the adiabatic approximation.
        - Modeling correctly the exact wave function at short interparticle distances 
          by explicitly introducing the interparticle distance in the functional form.
        - Reaching chemical accuracy through the exact diagonalization of the Schödinger 
          and Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonians in a basis set expansion of explicitly correlated functions.
          
    - title: Method development
      items:
        - Develop new ab-initio nuclear electron methods 
          that do not require any experimental parameters besides the charges and
          masses of the particles involved, and that describe accurately quantum nuclear effects.
        - I introduced the Nuclear Electronic All Particle (NEAP) providing
          more accurate zero-point energies and proton densities than state-of-the-art results.

    - title: Topological and geometrical properties in molecular Hamiltonians
      items: 
        - Study the emergence of the topological Berry phase through the analysis of the exact nuclear 
          current vector field and the nuclear density in arbitrary precision floating-point arithmetic
          for increasing nuclear mass value. 
        - Investigate whether a non vanishing Berry phase survives, and if the non- analyticities 
          of the potential energy surfaces at the conical intersection points
          persist in the exact electron-nuclear treatment.
