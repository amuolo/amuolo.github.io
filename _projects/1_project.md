**Is it possible to observe the emergence of molecular structure as an inherent feature of quantum theory without making empirical assumptions?**

The Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation separates electronic and nuclear motions under the assumption 
that electrons can follow the nuclear dynamics almost instantaneously and provides the mathematical 
basis for several important notions central to molecular systems. 
This separation led to the clamped nuclei approximation and the notion of electronic stationary states 
that adjust themselves to any nuclear configurations in space, namely the so-called molecular structure. 
The BO separation of light and heavy particles established a natural connection between classical 
chemistry and quantum mechanics as genuine chemical notions of molecular structure, isomer, conformer, 
chirality, bond, valence and connectivity can be translated into the formalism of quantum mechanics.

> We describe the six degrees of freedom of the ground state of the helium atom
(considered as a 3-particle problem with the center-of-mass motion separated)
as a problem of two interacting particles in an external Coulomb potential.
However, in the case of the molecule H2+ we discuss the very same type of
differential equation in an entirely different way, and split the 6 degrees of
freedom into 1 vibrational mode, 2 rotational modes, and 3 electronic type
degrees of freedom. This qualitatively different description does by no means
follow from a purely mathematical discussion.

This reasoning indicates that the introduction of the BO approximation implies making an a priori 
assumption about the existence of a particular structure for atoms and another one for molecules. 
The following question then arises spontaneously: is it possible to observe the emergence of 
molecular structure as an inherent feature of quantum theory without making empirical assumptions? 
Answering this question is related to the very complex problem of studying interparticle 
correlation effects for systems of particles interacting with attractive and/or repulsive forces. 
Contrary to the simple case of two repelling particles manifesting a symmetric Coulomb hole, 
the general case of interacting particles involves asymmetric radial wave function profiles 
with angular anisotropy, e.g. in atomic excited states.
Further careful analysis is required for the proper description of correlation effects resulting 
from the repulsion of charged equivalent particles subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. 

Both the description of quantum systems excluding empirical assumptions and the accurate 
treatment of inter-particle correlations, are the target of this research project.
