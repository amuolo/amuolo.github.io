In 1984, Berry defined the so-called molecular Berry phase as the integration of the Born-Oppenheimer vector
potential along a closed loop in the nuclear coordinate space. While the molecular Berry phase vanishes if the 
relevant surface is smooth, if the loop encloses a conical intersection of adiabatic potential energy surfaces, 
the molecular Berry phase may have a finite value. However, although the molecular Berry phase has been studied 
extensively in the literature, its definition is intrinsically problematic: to be non vanishing there needs to 
be a conical intersection of Born-Oppenheimer surfaces, but the intersection is exactly the place in nuclear 
configuration space where the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is expected to break down because the electronic 
and nuclear excitations occur on the same energy scale. 
This raises the question whether one can inspect the molecular geometric phase without making the BO approximation.

This research project tackles this long-standing problem by exploiting the exact electron-nuclear factorization, 
that is the exact wave function can be factored into a single product of a conditional and marginal wavefunctions.
Like the Born-Oppenheimer Ansatz, the exact factorization can be used to define exact potential energy surfaces 
and vector potentials, from which the "exact Berry phase" can be evaluated.
