Earning my PhD in Natural Sciences from the ETH Zürich rewarded my strong affection and curiosity for natural phenomena
and marked the start of several independent research projects spanning from methods development to algebraic manipulation 
and novel analytical and numerical solutions to integrals emerging in relativistic quantum mechanics.

I specialize in computer simulations, algorithm engineering, numerical methods and innovation. 
Throughout my academic career, I have been developing and maintaining programs written in modern C++ using several libraries, 
such as Boost, Armadillo, Eigen, Intel MKL, and tools such as Mathematica.
The methods I develop can run flexibly on desktop hardware or supercomputers. To achieve the maximum performance
I designed each algorithm to be intrinsically parallel, and I mastered SIMD, OpenMP, MPI, OpenAcc standards, and in general 
different coding techniques and design patterns.

Today, I work as Software Engineer and Business Analyst at Systemorph, an innovative Swiss startup focusing 
on scalable resilient cloud web applications for the insurance industry sector. 
I am also a developer of the Systemorph Cloud platform and the Systemorph open-source IFRS 17 calculation engine.
In this role, I have had the fortune to develop tailor-made web applications, understanding cloud architecture design, 
microservices, and actor-model.
Moreover, I have been able to complement my technical abilities with business oriented knowledge ranging from data modelling 
to implementing data model, business rules, and business processes with a special focus on auditability and governance. 
I have also been granted the possibility to conduct a POC, organize on-site workshops and presentations to showcase 
our products and APIs, highlighting the USP of our technology. 

I believe my work experience allowed me to stand as a powerful and flexible force, using my collaborative spirit, high-motivation, 
positive attitude and tireless energy to drive the colleagues and clients to achieve their goals effortlessly.  

My career and personal development are fueled by a persistent curiosity.

<!-- I don't see physics as a tool just to build technologies. I see technologies as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature
and reveal more about this hidden world outside of our experiences. -->
