As quantum technology evolves and advances, the classical and quantum computation become increasingly more integrated,
to be able to tackle real-life applications with existing quantum hardware. 
The idea is to combine both classical and quantum computers in an attempt to take advantage of “the best of both worlds”.

Together with state-of-the-art hardware and a bridging technology, I am studying these hybrid algorithms 
to try to achieve an advantage over classical computing in areas such as optimization, machine learning, and simulation.
