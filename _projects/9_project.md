During a Proof of Concept (POC), I developed a robust and extendible data model to support the Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) 
to assess the risk of an insurer and its solvency situation under different normal and severe stress scenarios.
The POC also involved analyzing the complexity and further optimizing the existing algorithms to perturb the economic profit figures.
Finally, two digital workflows were designed to be able drive the ORSA process for a company consisting of different legal entities
across multiple years and quarters. A very important attention was put on governance and auditability.
