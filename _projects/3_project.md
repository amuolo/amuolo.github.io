In the field of relativistic quantum mechanics, we elaborate on a relativistic fermionic theory 
based on the Dirac Hamiltonian, presenting a computational scheme for the approximation of 
positive-energy bound states in a basis set expansion of explicitly correlated Gaussians. 

Albeit the basis set expansion technique optimized by application of the variational principle 
is paramount when calculating numerically eigenstates of non relativistic Hamiltonians, their 
generalization to relativistic Hamiltonians is not an intrinsically safe procedure. 
The unboundedness of the Diracâ€“Coulomb Hamiltonians plagues the variational approach by the 
appearance of spurious eigenvalues below the positive-energy ground state. These states survive 
if one takes the non-relativistic limit and they are characterized by a poorly represented kinetic 
energy. The existence of the problem is now well known and several techniques have been proposed 
for its alleviation. Particularly important are conditions that make the trial wave function 
kinetically balanced, by satisfying the kinetic energy correctness in the non-relativistic limit. 
While for wave functions approximated as products of one-fermion orbitals, variational stability 
can be ensured and these approaches are routinely employed in relativistic 4-component calculations, 
there is the need to develop an efficient explicitly correlated variant of the kinetic balance
condition.

Thanks to this research project, it was possible to devise the exact kinetic-balance condition for
16-component explicitly correlated functions in order to ensure variational stability and avoid the
variational collapse. The two fermions are treated explicitly in the simple laboratory fixed 
cartesian coordinates and we avoid having to transform the Dirac Hamiltonian to internal coordinates.
Conversely, translationally invariant integrals are employed to ensure elimination of center-of-mass 
contributions from the expectation values.
